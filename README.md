**Dexfense Protocol** gamifies on-chain liquidity and enables users to directly engage with DeFi mechanics by participating in the liquidity cycle through gameplay. It replaces static, abstract swap interactions with action-based engagement, where in-game decisions yield direct rewards tied to actual liquidity flows.

### Core Objectives

- Provide **real swap opportunities through gameplay**, using meme tokens or existing Raydium liquidity pools
- Lower the **entry barrier to DeFi** and encourage active liquidity circulation
- Allow players to **intuitively and repeatedly experience the “risk = reward”** structure through game design

### Key Features

1. **Token-staked entry system**: Players use real assets (meme coins or LP tokens) to enter, directly tying participation to DeFi activities.
2. **Randomized enhancement selection**: Strategic decisions are required at each wave through randomly presented power-up options, directly affecting difficulty and potential rewards.
3. **Performance-based reward structure**: Players who succeed in survival earn higher reward multipliers, while those who fail face reduced or forfeited rewards—delivering the “risk equals reward” principle through gameplay.

Dexfense is not just a game—it's a form of **on-chain economic activity connecting liquidity with user participation**, aiming to expand the real use of DeFi ecosystems.
