# Dexfense Protocol

## Overview

Dexfense Protocol is a Solana-based GameFi application that gamifies on-chain liquidity. Players deposit assets to enter a tower defenseâ€“style game, where surviving waves unlock strategic power-ups and yield direct rewards tied to actual on-chain liquidity flows. By merging DeFi mechanics with engaging gameplay, Dexfense lowers the entry barrier to decentralized finance and delivers "risk = reward" experiences in a fun, interactive format.

## Closed Beta

* **Test Server (Open for 1 week)**: [http://134.185.109.88:3000/](http://134.185.109.88:3000/)

  * Used by closed beta testers to configure initial game difficulty and arbitrage ratios.
  * Enter your username and password on first visit (enable "First-time Visitor" checkbox).
  * All pool configurations and simulations are executed off-chain, enabling testers to normalize data and validate parameters before on-chain integration.
